# My Code is messy, this I know.  
Sooner or later I will clean it up, but for now it works!  
  
I'm acutally working on a full recoding of this api which is much cleaner.  
The methods used in the new version are much smarter and more optimized.  
I have no eta on when the new version will be done, I'm taking my sweet time, sorry.
